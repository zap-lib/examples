# Android Client-Server

This is an example of running the client and server on an Android device. Depending on the user's choice within a single application, it determines whether to run the client or the server. The client sends data obtained from the accelerometer sensor to the server, and the server moves a point on the screen based on the received data.

In Android Studio, open the `examples/android-client-server` project, then build and run it.
