This example demonstrates using a smartphone as a presentation clicker. The client sends events not only for on-screen UI interactions but also for hardware button events to the server.

## Server

```
$ cd examples/presentation-clicker
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run rebuild
$ npm start
```

## Client

In Android Studio, open the `examples/presentation-clicker` project, then build and run it.
